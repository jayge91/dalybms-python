## Daly Smart BMS Python Script
Python Script that monitors a Daly Smart BMS through UART USB and publishes the data to MQTT. If environment variable is enabled (not yet implemented), MQTT Discovery Topics will be published for HomeAssistant build in, so no need to add the sensors manually to HA.

#This is a work in Progress!
Feel free to modify anything here to fit your needs, or if you have an improvement, I'd be grateful if you submit a PR! (I'm REALLY not super savvy with this stuff and am cobbling together much of what I learned from various places)
I'm still far from finished, and I'm taking inspiration from lots of sources, so many I'd have a hell of a time backtracking to find and list them here.

ChatGPT has been teaching me python lol!
